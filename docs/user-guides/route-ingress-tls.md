# Ingress NGINX Controller With TLS

* Deploy graylog with `tls` as per parameters specified in Installation Guide
and `Ingress` with `tls` must be successfully created.

It can work with generated secret using `cert-manager` or with custom certificates.

# Route In Openshift

## Route Without TLS

```yaml
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <specify-uniq-route-name>
  namespace: <specify-namespace-where-graylog-service-is-installed>
spec:
  host: <specify-your-target-host-here>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: graylog-service 
    weight: 100
  port:
    targetPort: graylog
```

## Route With TLS

`Edge` Termination Type route will be auto generated alongwith Ingress, try to access route url.

If you face `502 Bad Response.` then you have to create `reencrypt` Route manually.
Please deploy graylog without Ingress e.g. `graylog.createIngress: false`
and refer to the following templates as an example to manually create Openshift Routes:

```yaml
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <specify-uniq-route-name>
  namespace: <specify-namespace-where-graylog-service-is-installed>
spec:
  host: <specify-your-target-host-here>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: graylog-service 
    weight: 100
  port:
    targetPort: graylog
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    destinationCACertificate: <place-CA-certificate-here-from-graylog-TLS-secret>
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
```

Example:

```yaml
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: graylog-route
  namespace: logging-operator
spec:
  host: <specify-your-target-host-here>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: graylog-service 
    weight: 100
  port:
    targetPort: graylog
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    destinationCACertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      .....
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
```

After creating above route changes if you got `net::ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` error on the browser then one of
the possible root causes is there is HTTP traffic between balancers and the cluster which means route is not
added in whitelist of the balancer. To resolve the issue connect with INFRA team to add the route to that list.

**Note:**: We need to provide the CA certificate generated by `cert-manager` in the `destinationCACertificate` field, which
you can find under `Workloads > Secrets`. While we used `cert-manager` to obtain the certificates, it can also work
with custom certificates.
